## Introduction  

In this project, I built a fully functioning e-commerce web application with AWS Amplify as the backend and React as a frontend.

AWS Amplify facilitates getting started with AWS for web and mobile app development because it is easy to use and flexible. It supposes a command line interface (CLI) and Graphical user interface (GUI) where you can configure AWS services.
