## Introduction  

In this project, I built a fully functioning e-commerce web application with AWS Amplify as the backend and React as a frontend.

AWS Amplify facilitates getting started with AWS for web and mobile app development because it is easy to use and flexible. It supposes a command line interface (CLI) and Graphical user interface (GUI) where you can configure AWS services.

## Project Business Logic
In this project, we will be having two personas, which are the seller and the buyer

### Seller
Below are what the seller should be able to do:

- Registration and login
- Update profile.
- View a list of all products on the platform.
- View more details of each product
- View their store, i.e., the products he/she added to the platform
- Manage their store
- View orders, i.e., orders placed on their product.

### Buyer
Below are what the buyer should be able to do:

- Registration and login
- Update profile.
- View a list of all products on the platform.
- View more details of each product
- Add products to their cart, i.e., the products they wish to place an order on
- View a list of all products in their cart.
- Checkout on each of the products in the cart to confirm the order
- View the list of orders made.
